  summary:
    "Started my journey at the peak of _[COVID-19](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19)_, started pursuing a Computer Science degree right after my highschool, since I knew I wanted to be on üíª since childhood. I recently graduated from the _[University of Western Ontario](https://www.uwo.ca/)_ (a proud Mustang) in the summer of 2024, where I was able to learn from the some of best professors and meet crazy minds. I have interned at some of the tech and retail companies, and I am currently working on my personal projects and learning about AI and DevOps.",
